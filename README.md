#####     Core Python Notes and Programs    #######

The points mentioned as "UNKNOWN" are topics of ADVANCE PYTHON. These will be added in the ADVANCE PYTHON NOTES along with the programs related to them. Additionally, you can find the references for respective topics and programs in their respective ".txt" PythonGitNotes branch.

Also, It is a simple notes which I made for myself so I can refer to technical terms and topics of Python documentation without going through the complete documentation repeatedly. This would have taken lot of my time, thus, READ, UNDERSTAND and PRACTICE it saving time and mind's energy.
