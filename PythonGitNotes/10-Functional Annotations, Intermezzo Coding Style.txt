FUNCTION ANNOTATIONS :
Optional metadata information about the types used by user-defined functions.
Syntax-
1. Annotations are stored in __annotations__ attribute of the function as a dictionary, no effect on other part of the function.
2. Parameter annotations are defined by a colon after parameter name, followed by an expression evaluating to the value of the annotation.
3. Return annotations are defined by literal ->, followed by an expression between parameter list and colon defining function definition's end.
INTERMEZZO : CODING STYLE-
Making code, writing code in a way so that it is easily understood by other developers(required when working in a team).
PEP 8 has emerged as coding style for Python- REASONS :
1. Promotes readable.
2. Eye-pleasing coding style.

IMPORTANT POINTS-
1. Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs. :
Y? : Good compromise between small indentation(allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.
2. Wrap lines so that they don't exceed 79 characters.
Y? : This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays.
3. Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.
4. When possible, put comments on a line of their own.
5. Use docstrings.
6. Use spaces around operators and after commas,but not directly inside bracketing constructs: 
a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4).
7. Name classes with CamelCase, functions and methods with lower_case_with_underscores.
8. Always use self as the name for the first method argument.
9. Don't use any non-ASCII characters in identifiers.
